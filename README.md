Co-connect is a rails prototype app built in one week as our first major project at LeWagon #989.
The goal of the project was to design, implement, and ship to production an airbnb clone within the week.
As a team, we decided that instead of house rentals, co-working spaces was a more interesting and relevant
topic for our project.

A user is able to sign up, log in, and log out. Once logged in, a user can create a co-working space, view all
spces within a certain radius, and book a space for a certain date. A user can also view all of their bookings and
spaces on their dashboard, accepting or rejecting any booking requests.

The main technologies implemented were:

Ruby on Rails
HTML & CSS
Bootstrap
PostgresQL
Heroku
Git & Github
